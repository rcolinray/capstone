# The Problem

Creating and managing a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) is a time-consuming endeavor. While creating the fictional world for the game, a dungeon master (DM) links together their own ideas about characters and plots with the rules of the game. When running the game, the DM must reference this information at a moments notice, and in whatever direction the players choose to explore.

*DMScreen* is a software tool designed for organizing and referencing the rules and story of a fictional world in order to ease the burden on the DM. It does so by automatically creating links to characters, locations, and rules as the DM writes. This creates a network of documents that allows the DM to rapidly navigate the fictional world. Similar to how an integrated development environment (IDE) for programming can complete the names of variables and functions as the user types, so does DMScreen autocomplete and link to various elements of the game.
