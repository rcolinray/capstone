The primary stakeholders for this system are dungeon masters for tabletop roleplaying games. Content publishers may be users as well, since someone may have to enter reference data in the system. The players in a campaign run by a dungeon master who uses this software are indirectly affected by it. If the software is effective in aiding the dungeon master, then the players will experience less down time as the dungeon master references rules. For this project, I will be focusing on dungeon masters for [Dungeons and Dragons, 5th edition](http://dnd.wizards.com).
