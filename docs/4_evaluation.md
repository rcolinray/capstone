## Process

The *DMScreen* usability test was carried out over Skype while the user was at home. At the beginning of the evaluation I asked the user to share their screen with me so I could see how they used the application. I then asked that they think aloud as they explored the interface.

## Tasks

The first task was to create a small portion of a brand new campaign. This involves creating a few rooms with descriptions, monster encounters, traps, and treasure. This task primarily exercises the file hierarchy and content editor, since it requires the user to create, organize, and edit new content.

The second task was to pretend they were running a small, pre-made campaign with real players. This task primarily exercises the reference search component of the interface.I wanted to answer the following questions:

- Can the user find information easily?
- How does the user handle having multiple references open simultaneously?
- If a reference has already been looked up once, will the user scroll to it in the reference list or will they look it up again?
- How does the user handle references with a large amount of content?

## Results

Below are the qualitative results of the usability test, organized by the interface components that they relate too.

### File Hierarchy and Editor

- Overall, users had no trouble understanding the file hierarchy and editor
- One user was confused about the distinction between story and location files
- Some users were confused by the button to edit the title, thinking it would edit the document instead of the title
- Some users wanted to be able to link documents, whereas others simply copy and pasted content from other documents

### References

- One user was confused about why they had to search for a file in the reference view when they already had it open in the editor
- Users tried to edit references
- Some users minimized references when they were done with them, while others closed them
- When many references were open, some users seemed to forget which references were already in the list and would search for them again instead of scrolling
- Some users tried to search for references using the content of the file or by using tags or groups

### General

- Some users expected to be able to drag files to different parts of the interface, primarily from the file hierarchy to the editor or reference view
- Users asked about being able to add images

## Conclusion

The feedback from users indicated that I am heading in the right direction with the interface design. For the tasks that I selected, creating and referencing content, users found the tool to be very useful. Users did not have much difficulty understanding the file hierarchy and editor, and they liked being able to look up references quickly. One user even remarked, “This looks ready. Can I use it in my campaign tonight?”

There is still plenty of room for improvement in all areas of the interface, especially the reference view. Users thought that references being read-only was limiting. Being able to have multiple references open at once was useful, but past a certain point users would forget which ones they had already opened and would simply search for them again rather than scroll. Users also indicated that a more flexible file hierarchy and support for images would be welcome improvements.

Based on the confusion towards the reference view, I think the next iteration of the *DMScreen* needs to focus on getting this feature right. Referencing information from the rulebooks is the most time-consuming task after creating content, so it's important that the reference tool meets the user's needs.

## Data

### User 1 Feedback

- Started by creating story chapter, adding description
- Used story chapters as rooms; “Less about levels and more about individual rooms”
- Wanted to link documents, tried writing “Troll here”
- Wanted to see all linked documents listed somewhere in the editor view
- Tried to drag files around
- Wanted to be able to see stats about their players
- Didn’t think reference search was useful; already found the file in the hierarchy, so why do I have to search for it too; search could be useful when there are a lot of things
- Wanted to edit in the references; two reference panels?
- Suggested being able to quick-look references before opening them
- Tags; drag-and-drop items/monsters into a room automatically tags them
- Did not think mapping was important

### User 2 Feedback

- When writing the story, entered difficulty check values (e.g., DC 15 dexterity save)
- Copied zombie stats into story chapter
- Multiple rooms in one story chapter
- Modifying stats (hit points) of copied monsters
- Being able to create tables is really useful
- Mostly ignored the reference area while building the campaign
- Being able to nest chapters, documents (hub-style narrative)
- “Keeping NPCs straight is difficult”
- “Reference bar is pretty clean”; want editing too
- Scrolling down might not be useful, would just search for it again; “Out of sight out of mind”; not remembering what is in the list already
- “Prefer this to my 11-page word document”
- Sees themselves sitting with books around them and computer open; “Books are useful because sometimes you see nearby entries”; assists in organization purposes
- “Shines more in-play”
- Wanted to add tags to documents
- Drag-and-drop + minimize in the story
- Images; want maps as reference
- References: wanted to start by typing group, then more specific information
- Character bar: weakness/resistance; combat information is only saved as an artifact
- Would still want to use file hierarchy during play
- Dice roller
	- sometimes you want to create drama with a roll, other times you just need a number
	- last roll
	- more often than not, just need a 20 roll

### User 3 Feedback

- Used locations for dungeon rooms
- Story: “Saying where it’s going to go” (linking documents)
- Double clicking things
- Likes being able to minimize references
- Title edit was confusing; thought it was for editing the document
- Wanted to add images
- Put room exits in a table
- Add room: used location folder instead of story; confused about usefulness of story vs. location
- Link other content: “4 skeletons, the lich”; open links in reference
- Want to roll dice in it; click on rolls in interface and have them auto-roll
- Edit references
- Closing references when done; “Might just leave them open”
- Want to track combat damage
- Being able to search reference content, not just title
- Keywords at the bottom of the editor
- Rearrange references; drag-and-drop
- Want to see dungeon map, but never actually moving characters around on the map; mark which area the players are in currently
- “Web app format might be good so you can search really easily in a new tab”
