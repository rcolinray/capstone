## Process

The DMScreen usability test was carried out over Skype while the user was at home. At the beginning of the evaluation I asked the user to share their screen with me so I could see how they used the application. I then asked that they think aloud as they explored the interface.

## Tasks

The first task was to create a small portion of a brand new campaign. This involves creating a few rooms with descriptions, monster encounters, traps, and treasure. This task primarily exercises the file hierarchy and content editor, since it requires the user to create, organize, and edit new content.

The second task was to pretend they were running a small, pre-made campaign with real players. This task primarily exercises the reference search component of the interface.I wanted to answer the following questions:

- Can the user find information easily?
- How does the user handle having multiple references open simultaneously?
- If a reference has already been looked up once, will the user scroll to it in the reference list or will they look it up again?
- How does the user handle references with a large amount of content?

## Conclusion

The feedback from users indicated that I am heading in the right direction with the interface design. For the tasks that I selected, creating and referencing content, users found the tool to be very useful. Users did not have much difficulty understanding the file hierarchy and editor, and they liked being able to look up references quickly. One user even remarked, “This looks ready. Can I use it in my campaign tonight?”

There is still plenty of room for improvement in all areas of the interface, especially the reference view. Users thought that references being read-only was limiting. Being able to have multiple references open at once was useful, but past a certain point users would forget which ones they had already opened and would simply search for them again rather than scroll. Users also indicated that a more flexible file hierarchy and support for images would be welcome improvements.

Based on the confusion towards the reference view, I think the next iteration of the DMScreen needs to focus on getting this feature right. Referencing information from the rulebooks is the most time-consuming task after creating content, so it's important that the reference tool meets the user's needs.
